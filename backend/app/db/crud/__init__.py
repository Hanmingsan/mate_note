# backend/app/db/crud/__init__.py

# Import specific CRUD functions or modules if you want to make them
# directly available when importing the 'crud' package.
# For example:
# from .crud_student import get_student, get_students, create_student, update_student, delete_student

# If you have a base CRUD class:
# from .base import CRUDBase

# Often, this file can also be left blank, similar to backend/app/db/__init__.py.
# Its primary role is to make 'crud' a package.
# You would then import specific functions like:
# from app.db.crud import crud_student
